library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("Salema-DG/Decomp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example using data from…

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
